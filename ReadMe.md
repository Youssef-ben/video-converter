# Videos and youtube converter

The idea of this project came from the fact that most of the free tools that exist on the internet have some restrictions like the length of the video, must watch ads, or a confusion UI with a lot of download buttons. With this, the need to create a free tool that has none of the inconvenience or restrictions like the others became stronger.

The **Videos and youtube converter** is a web/server application that will allows you to download youtube videos as `MP4s` or convert them to `MP3s` without any restriction.

## Disclaimer

This application should be used for **non-copyrighted** and open-source videos only and should be for personal use only.

If you wish to use any copyrighted videos from Youtube you must obtain expressed permission from the copyright owner.

# TODO

- Talk about the .env.example file
- Talk about how the server it works
- Talk about Can override config using Env Variables.
